# Statistical Tests

## Correlation

H0 hypothesis: There is not a relationship between Apple and Sp500

HA hypothesis: There is a relationship between variable Apple and Sp500

It seems that there is a linear relationship, however we must check for homogeneity of variance

#### Levene's Test of Homogeneity 

(statistic=35.46732173033491, pvalue=4.904150098936615e-09)

The test is significant. Our variances are not homogenous.
We should opt for a correlation test that doesn't assume homogeneity such as a spearman instead of a pearson.


Pearson correlation method (assumes homogeneity of variance)

(correlation=0.7478342928339387, pvalue=5.107535442948088e-46)

Spearman rank correlation method

(correlation=0.7321835035153023, pvalue=2.989768108578345e-43)

Conclusion: There is a high relationship between Apple and the overall market. 

## Chi Square Test

The H0 (Null Hypothesis): Trading outcome is independent of mondays and non-mondays.

The H1 (Alternative Hypothesis): Trading outcome is not independent of mondays and non-mondays.

### Expected matrix

|is_monday    | is_green |is_red|
|-------------| ---------|------|
|False        | 112.608  |91.392|
|True         | 25.392   |20.608| 

### Observed matrix

|is_monday   | is_green  |is_red|
|------------|-----------|------|
|False       |  110.0    |95.0  |
|True        |   28.0    |18.0  |

Results:(statistic=0.8007550294850146, pvalue=0.8492864317723491)

Conclusion: Cannot reject the null hypothesis. Wether a day trades in the red is independent of the day the stock is traded on.  (In this case, we used the stock prices of Apple)


## Linear Regression

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance

Goal: Find most impactful predictors of insurance premiums

Overview:


### Exploratory Analysis

According to our exploratory anaylsis, we see that gender and region do not impact the premiums. However, smoking is a strong predictor.

### Normality Test

![Image of model](https://github.com/MihaiGroza/statistical_tests/blob/master/Graphs/Probability%20Plot.png)

The residuals of our model is not normally distributed

### Homoscedasticity Test using Bruesch-Pagan

Lagrange multiplier statistic = 121.74360137568986

p-value = 1.446717553918174e-22               

The variance of our data is not homogenous. We will account for this in the model re-run.

#### Conclusion: 
According to our test, region and gender have little impact on insurance premiums which backs up our exploratory analysis
