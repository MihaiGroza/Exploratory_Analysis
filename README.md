HA hypothesis: There is a relationship between variable Apple and Sp500

It seems that there is a linear relationship, however we must check for homogeneity of variance

Levene's Test of Homogeneity 

LeveneResult(statistic=35.46732173033491, pvalue=4.904150098936615e-09)
The test is significant. Our variances are not homogenous.
We should opt for a correlation test that doesn't assume homogeneity such as a spearman instead of a pearson.


Pearson correlation method (assumes homogeneity of variance)
(correlation=0.7478342928339387, pvalue=5.107535442948088e-46)

Spearman rank correlation method
(correlation=0.7321835035153023, pvalue=2.989768108578345e-43)

Conclusion: There is a high relationship between Apple and the overall market. 

Chi Square Test

The H0 (Null Hypothesis): Trading outcome is independent of mondays and non-mondays.

The H1 (Alternative Hypothesis): Trading outcome is not independent of mondays and non-mondays.
